/// intermittently on a first connect in a crowded BLE environment, and the
/// stack needs about a second to release the slot after a failed attempt.
/// Makes at most [attempts] tries and rethrows the last failure so the caller
/// can map it to a user-visible error.
///
/// Claims [deviceId] for [owner] (see [BleClient.claimLink]). Returns true
/// once connected. Returns false when [shouldAbort] turns true, checked before
/// each attempt and after a successful one. On false or a rethrow, a link left
/// up is dropped unless a later connect has claimed the lamp.
///
/// The post-reboot reconnect loop in AddLampNotifier is a different policy. It
/// disconnects a stale handle, waits out the firmware reboot, and wraps a
/// per-attempt timeout.
